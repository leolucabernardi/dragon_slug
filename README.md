# Dragon Slug Chess Engine

This project is currently in development. As the name suggests, right now the goal is not for it to be very fast, but rather for me to learn how to use rust trying to get it to run, or rather slither.


- Nothing works at the moment :)

Thank you for checking out Dragon Slug! 

Also have a look at the [animal](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucus_atlanticus) this project was named after while you are already browsing random reposiories on GitHub :)

## Features
As I am working on this while attending university, updates and improvements are sporadic at best.
